- Problem/Solution Section: Problem/Solution section highlighting key anxieties of users and offering AI-driven solutions with clear, concise text and supporting icons.
- How It Works: Step-by-step 'How it works' section explaining the process (chat input, AI communication, result delivery) with visuals and minimal text.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Accent Red (#FF6B6B) for key CTAs to draw the user's attention to sign-up opportunities. The intention of a user leaving their job would need a high contrast, vivid color like this.
- Background color: Light Gray (#F4F6F8) for section transitions. It is of a similar hue to the primary red, but much more desaturated.
- Text color: Dark Gray (#333333) for readability and a professional feel.
- Clean, modern, and highly readable Japanese font, prioritizing clarity on both desktop and mobile.
- Mobile-first design with a focus on vertical scrolling and clear section separation.
- Subtle animations for UI feedback (e.g., button hover states, form submission confirmation).
